# python-learn

Going to be learning python seriously now.
Hopefully this will be helpful reference in the future.

Some things to note:

- Install Git for windows.
- git config --global user.email "email@gmail.com"
- git config --global user.name "username"
- Run git push to get dialog box to login.
- After succesful login try to git commit -> git push.
