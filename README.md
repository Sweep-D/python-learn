# python-learn

Going to be learning python seriously now.
Hopefully this will be helpful reference in the future.

Some things to note:

- Install Git for windows. https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.24.1.windows.2/Git-2.24.1.2-64-bit.exe
- git config --global user.email "email@gmail.com"
- git config --global user.name "username"
- Run git push to get dialog box to login.
- After succesful login try to git commit -> git push.
